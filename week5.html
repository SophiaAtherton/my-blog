<h2>moodboard 3</h2>
<img src="assets/moodboard-3.png">
<p>following last weeks presentation feedback, I reviewed my stylescapes and developed a third option that would expand my creative palette. While it would have more components making it harder to achieve, pushing myself rather than staying in my comfort spot will help me develop my skills.</p>
<p> This concept combines contemporary design, which incorporates the use of digital and traditional media with hand drawn elements and textures, and reinvented naturalism which you can see with the earthy tones and textures, and the more fluid shapes.</p>

<h2>Logo Progression</h2>
<img src="assets/logo-progression.jpg">

<p>The progression of my logos was heavily dependant on the stylescape that was strongest and over the period of my developing time I changed the styling and donts. However the starting logo weren't scaleable and had too many colour that wouldn't work on different backgrounds. So my final has a light and dark version rather than blending too many colours and sizes together as it took away from the logo and looked tacky. Especially for a website where it nees to be easily seen as a logo symbol even if it's small which the other logo icons wouldn't do.</p>
