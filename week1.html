<h2>
  Aucklands issues: my understanding
</h2>
<p>Living in Auckland faces many issues ones that not only me and my circle find are true but the widespread communities in Auckland also feel. 
  During my research I found three main issues that peaked my interest. The first is how Aucklanders are feeling more lonely. With statistics showing that almost half of Aucklanders feel this way, and that the rise in the feeling of loneliness significantly affected younger people who also felt more isolated. The feeling of isolation, and loneliness can lead to mental health problems which then affects the quality of life for those individuals. Financial hardship, high rent, and limited affordable opportunities contribute to this feeling of isolation for the younger people.</p>
<p>Which leads me to my second issue, youth in auckland are also seeing more difficulty to find jobs. The unemployment rate for those aged 20-24 in auckland is at 8.7% which is a 2.3% increase from the previous year. This ties back in with the loneliness epidemic, if employment rates aren’t fixed/ balanced out it could further affect the lineliness that the young people are affected by.</p>
<p>The inequality between the poor vs the rich to put it simply in auckland is the third main point. the gap between the rich and poor in Auckland is worse than what it was in WWII, with communities not seeing the cities economic growth. There is a gap in housing affordability and employment opportunities for those in South auckland compared to other areas along with education opportunities for young people in the same area. If such a large part of Auckland is affected by these things others in Auckland who live in other areas will also be heavily affected by the same issues. </p>

<h2> summary of findings *</h2>
<p>Living in Auckland presents a range of struggles that not only affect me and my immediate circle but are also affecting the rest of Auckland and its broader communities. Through my research I found three issues that interconnected and that I think are things that should be addressed. </p>
<p>Almost 47% of Aucklanders reported feeling some level of loneliness in 2024. This issue especially affects younger people. With covid having a significant affect on them. The covid 19 pandemic significantly disrupted social lives and support systems. 42% of youth in New Zealand reported that the pandemic had a negative impact on their health and wellbeing. social isolation was especially common as many young people lost friendships during lockdowns and struggled to reconnect afterwards. Social media provided a light aid but it often deepened feelings of exclusion. The rise in demand for mental health services at Auckland universities indicated that young people in the widespread community are seeking more help but may not be getting that support they’re needing.</p>
<p>The sense of isolation is closely tied to the issue of youth unemployment. The youth unemployment rate for those aged 20 to 24 rose to 8.7% in 2024 which was a 2.3% increase from the previous year. The NEET rate - those not in employment, education, or training, hit its highest point in March 2021. Between 2020 and 2021, the number of 18-24 year olds on job seeker increased by 68%. Graduates are also struggling with only 19% confident in their job prospects, which is down by 28% from the previous year. A major factor behind this issue is New Zealands hidden job market, where 70% of roles are not advertised publicly. Instead jobs are often filled through existing and established networks, which leads to a major disadvantage to those without strong social ties such as migrants (outside the country and those just moving city to city), and those from less-connected communities.</p>
<p>The socioeconomic divide in Auckland further deepens these issues. Despite the city seeing a lot of economic growth, not all communities reap those benefits. The gap between the rich and the poor is now wider than what it was in world war II. South Auckland is particularly affected by this divide with lack of affordable housing, fewer job opportunities, being further from the city and reduced access to education. These inequalities mean that even highly educated and employed individuals can still experience homelessness. The lack of community-driven support systems in these areas further isolate individuals. </p>
<p>These issues illuminate a concerning picture of disconnect in Auckland. Lack of community and connections can lead to many issues personally and professionally. Taking everything into account I must consider how I can actually aid the people of Auckland far and close, what tools could I provide through graphic design to not fix these issues but hopefully provide a crutch for those in need of social connect and community, professional relationships and connections.</p>

<h3>TLDR; why these issues are intertwined</h3>
<p>These issues aren’t separate, they’re deeply connected.
  Loneliness, unemployment, and inequality all feed into each other.
  When people feel isolated socially, they struggle to grow professionally.
  When jobs and opportunities are gate-kept, whole communities fall behind.
  This is more than individual struggle, it’s a city-wide disconnect.</p>

<section class="content-highlighted">
<h2>problem statement*</h2>
  <p>Young people in Auckland are experiencing rising levels of isolation, unemployment, and inequality challenges that are being intensified by limited access to support networks and less support networks being available. The hidden job market and a lack of inclusive community spaces make it difficult for those who aren't "in the know" and/ or don't have already established connections to maintain their wellbeing and feel a sense of belonging in the city.</p>
<br>
  <h2>target audience*</h2>
<p>Young Aucklanders (aged 20-25) who are early in their careers or finishing studies, particularly those who have relocated to Auckland. They are seeking to establish themselves in their field of work and would like to build professional connections. They value meaningful face to face interactions but often experience isolation and disconnect.</p>

<h3>interview summary participant 1</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Limited Access to Professional Development for Non-Full-Time Teachers</li>
  <ul>Relief teachers (similar to casual or part-time roles) often miss out on professional development opportunities typically offered to full-time staff.</ul>
<ul>Most PD events are course-based and school-affiliated, limiting accessibility.</ul>
<ul>However, being part of the teacher’s union offers occasional updates and smaller events via email.</ul>
<li>Need for Stronger Peer Networks</li>
<ul>Young or beginning teachers feel isolated, especially due to age and experience gaps with older staff.</ul>
<ul>There’s a desire for peer-led social and professional events to share experiences, discuss challenges, and support one another.</ul>
<ul>Students expressed interest in age-specific networking opportunities to build confidence and find mentorship.</ul>
<li>Lack of Teaching-Specific University Events</li>
<ul>Aside from general university activities (e.g., Club Expo, hall events), there’s a shortage of events tailored to education students.</ul>
<ul>One past event—the Education and Social Work Ball—was well-liked but discontinued due to low numbers.</ul>
<ul>Celebratory moments (like post-capstone shared lunches) were meaningful, but rare.</ul>
<li>Networking is Crucial for Employment</li>
<ul>Job opportunities in teaching are often influenced by who you know—personal connections made during placements or via previous schools often lead to job offers.</ul>
<ul>Participants believe that even in teaching (less so than engineering), relationship-building with schools is vital for employment.</ul>
<li>Desire for More Inclusive, Career-Focused Events</li>
<ul>There’s strong interest in social-meets-career events—like mingling sessions, TED-style talks, or large formal gatherings—that help:</ul>
<ul>Make job-seeking less isolating</ul>
<ul>Foster peer and mentor relationships</ul>
<ul>Offer insights into navigating the profession</ul>
</ol>

<hr>
<h3>interview summary participant 2</h3>
<ol>
<li>Time & Energy Management Is a Major Challenge</li>
<ul>Struggles with maintaining consistent routines like meal prepping.</ul>
<ul>Feels drained and overstimulated without regular “me time” to reset and clean.</ul>
<ul>Often micromanages tasks mentally rather than writing them down—acknowledges this can be inefficient, especially when working with others.</ul>
<li>Motivation Tied to Progress and Social Connection</li>
<ul>Feels most motivated when achieving milestones in work or study.</ul>
<ul>Gains energy from quality time with friends and family—social connection is central to well-being.</ul>
<ul>Personal fulfilment is less about productivity and more about being present and relaxed with others.</ul>
<li>Academic Load Limits Professional Development</li>
<ul>Currently focused on finishing a demanding degree in computer science and physics.</ul>
<ul>Previously worked while studying but found it unsustainable with a heavier course load this year.</ul>
<ul>Recognises that balancing work and study is hard, especially when the job isn’t fulfilling.</ul>
<li>Career Pressure and Job Search Fatigue</li>
<ul>Feels pressure when comparing themselves to peers who appear more accomplished.</ul>
<ul>Describes the tech job application process as long and exhausting (multiple stages, heavy time investment).</ul>
<ul>Finds rejection after effort particularly demotivating, and knows peers in tech who feel similarly.</ul>
<li>Tools & Strategies</li>
<ul>Uses Notion to track deadlines, uni schedules, and job applications.</ul>
<ul>Doesn’t use many other tools—relies mostly on internal organisation.</ul>
<ul>Recognises benefit in writing things down but hasn’t fully built that habit.</ul>
<li>Limited but Valued Community Involvement</li>
<ul>Was previously active in a Women in Science club, organising social events—misses that involvement this year.</ul>
<ul>Feels less connected to new people outside university settings, but enjoys socialising with peers.</ul>
<ul>Attends 21st events and uni expos where networking and social interaction happen naturally.</ul>
<li>Aspirations for Stability</li>
<ul>Long-term hopes include: a stable job in tech, close family ties, potentially home ownership, and maybe starting a family.</ul>
<ul>Aware of economic barriers to home ownership and success in Auckland—open to moving elsewhere in the future.</ul>
</ol>
