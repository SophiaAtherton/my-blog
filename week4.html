    <p>I started off with paper prototypes to get a general understanding of how I wanted to lay out my pages, and what pages needed to be done before I started mocking them up on figma</p>

<h2>Lo-fi</h2>

<p>Following my paper prototyping I went on to do a rough layout idea on figma to see how things should be layed out properly. As it is a mobile first website, due to the target audience being younger and more likely using mobile, I started off by mocking things up in mobile sizing.</p>
<p>From here I will conduct my user testing next week to see if its intuitive and what the users I tet on think of the layouts</p>
